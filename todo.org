* TODO Many expired learn request is still running in teacher						:algo:
  A server is very slow on loading intances for learning, that cause
  the backend thread run in full CPU for a long time. Then, the
  learner can not caught up others and send learn request again and
  again. 

  Analysed it and found that the root cause is slow rocksdb read on
  this disk.

* TODO The stop order of ServerManger is not good for HTTService and JaxosService		     :network:
* TODO Test will use a ring index to store instance in rocksdb will reduce file size			 :log:
* TODO There is a gap when server shutdown and switch leader sometimes 					:algo:
  It's because that a request has been chosen but the HTTP response
  has no chance to feed back. So, the client has to re-send the same
  request and the processed one abandoned.

  The solution maybe let client curry an uniqure request finger print
  to indicate the request just as the ix in DB transaction.
